Imagine the role of a building architect. 
The process of creating a new building typically goes through various stages of planning, designing and construction.
The architect must consider environmental impact, governing laws in the surrounding area, building functionality and aesthetic style.

A successful architectural plan can result in a beautiful building that will withstand the tests of time.
Indeed, some of the oldest buildings in the world not only have withstood the tests of time, they have transformed the cities where they were built and changed the lives of the architects who designed them!

You are a network designer; thus, you are an architect who builds networks.
Network architecture is a lot like building architecture - you must consider proper planning, design, flow adn construction of the network you are about to design.
