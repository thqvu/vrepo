Generally speaking, a backhaul link is any link that connects the small subnetworks at the edges (access or aggregation networks) to the core network. Within the context of LTE, this would provide the transport for the eNodeB to the S-GW, or the S1-U interface described in the LTE section. It could also carry inter-eNodeB traffic/signaling for mobility events (X2 interface) or eNodeB to MME signaling (S1-MME interface). Traditionally, backhaul links have been TDM-based, such as T1/E3. Multiple TDM links could be bundled together to support higher bandwidth backhaul links, but over time this became less profitable. Ethernet has been used very successfully given its lower cost and higher bandwidth compared to traditional TDM technologies. SONET/SDH can also be used but is less common. Wireless backhaul can be popular for a number of reasons, but comes with drawbacks as well. The benefits of wireless backhaul using microwave links is that they are easy/fast to deploy and allow moving POPs as nescessary. They tend to be slower than wired connections (less bandwidth) and are viewed as a temporary measure. Assuming high towers are available, microwave links are more desirable, cheaper, and more scalable than copper links, but not as desirable as fiber. Cell towers, for example, are migrating from wireless to fiber optic connections. For smaller nodes where POPs require mobility, wireless backhaul is the best option for the RAN. Wireless links can be licensed or unlicensed; the FCC regulates power output restraints both, but the difference is that spectrum for unlicensed bands is not managed by anyone.
