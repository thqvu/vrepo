IP Routing refers to forwarding packets from one interface to another
    - The goal is to forward packets in the right direction
        + To a device that is one-step closer to the packet's destination (Next-Hop)
    - Routing decisions are made independently by using a Routing Table (RIB)
        + Consists of routes (networks, subnets), their Next-Hops and other information

Routing Tables are populated by three different sources of information
    - Connected Routes
        + Networks calculated based on IP addresses configured on device interfaces
            . IPv6 Link-Local addresses are not included
        + Don't have a Next-Hop   
    - Static Routing
        + Manually configured routes (ip/ipv6 route)
    - Dynamic Routing
        + Routes are learned through routing protocol(s), such as EIGRP or OSPF

Other RIB components include Administrative Distance (AD) and Metric
    - If a single same-length prefix is learned from more than one source, only one of them can be inserted into a RIB
        + A lower Administrative Distance (AD) route is always preferred
            . For example 10.1.1.0/24 can be learned from OSPF and configured statically
    - If routes are coming from the same source (equal AD), then lower Metric route wins
        + If metrics (costs) are equal, most routing protocols allow to insert two (or more) equal-cost routes
            . Known as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing
