If you want to successfully sell a design plan that incorporates solutions from Juniper Networks, you will need to know your competition, what they offer, and how their solution matches up with what you have to offer.

In some instances, the customer might only be familiar with proprietary systems or protocols due to their experience with a competitor. In these situations, you can often counter with a similar solution that Juniper Networks offers, but is compliant with standards that will allow for greater scalability in the future.

In some situations, you will need to build a design around an existing solution from a competitor. You might need to design a solution that can live in harmony with other vendors. This means switching from proprietary services to using more standardized protocols. In all cases, you should be able to understand and easily explain how your design will respond to questions regarding the competition.

Regardless of who your customer has worked with in the past, or what equipment is in their current environment, you must be able to show total confidence in your network design. # Confidence is key

Feeling comfortable with your design means that you can provide immediate feedback when customers ask questions related to competing services. Do not focus on what your solution can't provide. Likely, there is an alternate solution that your design will provide that can meet any challenge from competing products. Customers-and people in general-can be wary of change.

Understanding what you do best and focusing on those key areas will help the customer gain confidence in your plan. # Focus on what you do best
