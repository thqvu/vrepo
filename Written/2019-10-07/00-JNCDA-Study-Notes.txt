Juniper's Lifecycle Service Approach: Plan (Assess,Design),Build (Deploy,Migrate) and Operate (Support,Optimize)

Plan Methodology

Assess->Requirements->Scope->Data Analysis
Requirements: identify the technology shortfalls that need to be addressed
Scope: Determine the scope of the design project; upgrading a existing network or creating an entirely new network?
Data Analysis: Perform a data analysis to determine the condition of the current network and what improvements need to be made; How many users access the network internally and externally?

Design->Logical Design->Physical Design

Logical Design: High Level Design, protocols used, addressing, security, name conventions.It also might include WAN and service provider access

Physical Design: Low Level Design,Physical devices, cabling, wiring considerations. Service Provider access should be determined by this point

Chapter 3: Understanding Customer Requirements

The Request for Proposal (RFP)

Solicitation from the customer for a network design that typically includes:
-A list of design requirements
-Types of solutions the design must provide
-Warranty requirements and legal terms

The customer will often send the RFP to multiple vendors and
-Use responses to compare competing proposals
-Eliminate vendors who cannot meet their requirements

In some cases, you might receive a Request for Information (RFI), rather than an RFP.RFI typically only covers the technical aspects of the design request.

RFP Key Elements

Business requirements
-Summary of what type of business the customer is in
-Vision for future growth
-Explanation of why a new design is required

Environmental requirements
-facility specifications
-Number of users and workstations requirements
-Server room specifications

Modular requirements
-Hierarchical design considerations
-Reduction of information within each module
-Functionality of each module within the design

In a modular design, each device has a clearly assigned function

Connectivity and throughput requirements
-Number of wireless and wired connections needed
-Traffic analysis
-Calculations for theoretical and overhead traffic

Business continuity
-Network efficiency
-Quality of service requirements
-Load balanced and highly available networks

Always offer solutions by focusing on what your solution can do rather than what it does not support

Responding to the RFP

Tips for a successful response:attention to the details,using the format of the customer, highlight benefits of your design

Response should always include:
-Executive Summary
-A network topology
-Information on the devices, protocols, technologies forming the design
-An implementation plan
-Training
-A plan for supporting and servicing the design

Defining Key Stakeholders

Understand the Corporate Structure:Management Hierarchy,Decision Makers, Corporate structure, Who has final say?
Asking the right People the Right Questions:Business goals,Technical goals, Existing network details, Technical requirements
Understanding Corporate Politics:Hidden agendas,Department relations, Personnel issues,Business policies

Gathering Data

Questionnaires, Surveys, Interviews, Job Aids

Job Aids:Documentation and instructions allowing individuals to quickly access the information needed to perform a task

Traffic flow analysis
-Capacity
-Utilization
-Throughput
-Offered load
-Efficiency
-Latency

You must determine the limitations to the current network and what is required for the new network to be successful

Identifying Applications

Identify applications the customer uses
Include both existing and new applications
Include user applications and system applications

Understanding Scope

Designing with modularity in mind will help you accommodate any network the customer has asked you to design

Analyzing the Existing Environment
-Working on greenfield projects (referred as design a network from a ground up)
--New networks with or not restraints to consider
--Next-generation networks created from the ground up
--adding new network to an existing architecture

-Upgrading existing networks
--old gear to be replaced
--legacy applications that are no longer use
--out-of-date Designs that no longer make sense

Identifying resources
-Creating equipment lists
--Bill of materials(BOM)
--can be modular or multilevel in nature

-Setting pricing and understanding budgets
--Create a plan that matches the customer's budget
--Consider all expenses such as staffing, testing and training
--does your plan eliminate jobs and add personnel?

More complex BOMs can be multilevel-or nested-lists whose parent devices are listed with a set of a child devices nested in two or more levels of detail.

Chapter 4 Organizing the Data

The data you have collected can be sorted into three main categories:customer data, customer requirements, and project boundaries

Data analysis

-Organizing the data can be based on:Functional area (campus, WAN, data center)
-User groups (employees, guests, remote users)
-Customer requirements

Six main categories:Security, Availability, Scalability, Manageability, Performance, Budget

Sample Security requirements:NAC,Management, Compliance, BYOD
Sample Availability requirements:Archival and Backup, Resiliency, Failover, Capacity
Sample Scalability requirements:User Base, Applications, Hardware, Performance
Sample Manageability requirements:Monitoring, Automation, Configuration Management, Auditing
Sample Performance requirements:Bandwidth, Latency, Quality of Service, Optimization

Identifying Design Proposal Boundaries

Some of the more common boundaries include:
-Characterizing existing and future user groups, their respective applications, data flows, and data flow types
-Identifying required network parts such as campus WAN, remote office locations, and the data center
-Documenting the current environment
-Determining budgetary constraints

Identifying the unknown boundaries that exist. This might include hidden agendas from employees, governmental laws or statues that were not previously identified

Greenfield Versus Brownfield

Greenfield Deployments
-More options to make design module and scalable
-Very few restraints caused by existing network infrastructure

Brownfield Deployments
-More common and much more restrictive than Greenfields
-Often require integration with other vendors

User Groups and Applications

Determine the types of users that will be accessing the network and what applications they use, enforcing security whilst maintaining accessibility, ease of use, and performance benchmarks will be a top priority

Considering Data Flow

You must identify the types of communication that happen-or will happen-on the network. Determining the traffic patterns currently in sue-as well as calculating the data flow for future network

Traffic patterns:user to user;user to machine;machine to machine

Functional Parts of the Network

Three main functional areas in network design, including campus (and branch), WAN, and data center connections

Exceeding Know Boundaries

Provide additional value:Make a proposal that goes beyond the know boundaries and stated customer requirements
Provide Options:Good;Better;Best

Design Proposal Considerations

When creating design proposals:
-Keep your design simple
-Create the logical before the physical structure
-Consider security throughout the design process
-Understand the design boundaries and scope
-Remember that every choice has a trade-off
-Ensure that your proposal is clearly documented

Keeping Things Simple
-Overly complex designs and customer perception
-Considering modularity in network design

Incorporating Security

Every functional area of your network topology will require some level of security within it.

Choices and Trade-offs

Security
Availability
Scalability
Manageability
Performance
Budget

You should be aware that each choice you make will include certain trade-offs.For example, implementing security can affect performance

Capacity Planning

Consider these steps:
1.Form a discussion groups
2.Quantify user behavior
3.Quantify application behavior
4.Determine baseline existing network
5.Make Traffic projections:capture data of bandwidth utilization by packet type and protocol,packet and frame size distribution,, error/collision rates
6.Summarize input data for design process

Design Stages-Design Specification

Detail document of the design
-Acts as a benchmark for design changes
-Final design choices and changes need justification and documenting
-Should include change history to aid maintenance
-Used for the implementation

Chapter 5: Securing the Network

Evolution of Network Security

Remote access, wireless devices,virtual servers, external hard drives and USB sticks are attack vector

Security Threats Facing Networks Today

Hackers,Spies,User authentication,Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Wired Users, BYOD, Guest users, SQL Injection, Password Cracking, DDoS

Campus and Branch

Common security requirements:
-User authentication-Access control
-Firewall and zone-based segmentation
-IDP
-UTM
-Point-of-sale (PoS) compliance (typically branch only)

Does the customer have a compliance reason for security?
-PCI-compliance, SOX, and so on-How much access do the users need?
-Will full Internet access be required?
-Will users need to authenticate for network access

How much security can the enterprise manage?

Context Awareness and Authentication

Which user?What application?Which device?Which location?


Authentication
-Wired and wireless authentication
--802.1x, EAP but other methods might be used

-Enables role-based access control
--Allows access to resources or networks based on user-credentials such as group membership
--Enables detailed logging and accounting of user activity
Authenticate every device every time
--Enables the highest levels of network security
--Must support smartphone and tablet users

Network Access Control (NAC)

NAC has become essential for enterprise networks
Increasing number of remote workers, contract workers, and other guests on the network

Defining Security Policies

Policies are needed to communicate between zones
Policy Components:Zones, Source, Destination, application and match criteria
Authentication:will policy require firewall, UAC, or VPN authentication
Do not forget about deny rules and placement

Security Policy Best Practices

Summarize IP addressing wherever possible
Use address-sets and service-groups
Add a deny all rule with session logging last

IDP Best Practices

Security Policies:On which policies should we enable IDP
Recommended signatures
Custom signature groups

You should determine to which security policies you want to enable IDP

-Detect-only or drop traffic
--Might want to start out in detect-only mode
--Analyze real-world traffic for false-positives
--User custom signature groups that exclude false-positives
--Change configuration to begin dropping attacks

UTM Best practices

Antivirus
URL filtering
Antispam
Intrusion Prevention

Where will UTM be enforced?
-From branch users and guests to internet?
-From internet to branch guest users?
-From branch users to centralized services?
-Inbound traffic from data center to branch?
-Traffic between branches?

Security Policies:On which ones should we enable UTM?
Antivirus UTM policies: Outbound (to Internet) matching HTTP and FTP

URL filtering UTM policies:Typically enabled on outbound (to Internet) Web traffic only

PCI Compliance

Main requirements for designing a PCI compliant solution
-Devices processing transactions must be isolated from other network nodes
-Account information cannot be stored or transmitted in unsecure fashions
-Firewall policy, reporting, and centralized management are key criteria
-Authenticate network access

Being able to demonstrate PCI compliance to the auditors is important for a yearly report on compliance (ROC)

WAN Security

Identify the untrusted domains and determine plan to monitor, manage, and mitigate all security risks

Public Model
-Service Provider provides transparent MPLS service to the customer
-No management required by the customer
-Security through MPLS


Hybrid Model
-Customer manages CPE devices:traffic is again secured through MPLS
-Home users and remote sites are secured using IPsec tunnels

Data Center Security Requirements

Requirements
-Scalable performance
-Interface flexibility:Scale the Firewall without re-architecting the network
-System and network resiliency:Carrier-class reliability;separation of data and control planes
-Network segmentation capabilities
-Flexible network integration

Data Center Security Challenges

Performance requirements:Traffic throughout, connection per second,sustained total connections, latency
Resiliency requirements:
Scalability:
Network Integration:Routing and Virtualization capabilities

DC Security Design Considerations

Considerations:
-Consolidation and virtualization
-Security versus performance tradeoffs
-On-demand resource allocation
-Polymorphic nature of new applications
-Evolving threat landscape
-Control over all the traffic client to server, server to server, and server to client
-High performance and security at scale
-Application Layer visibility and control
-Identity-aware dynamic security protection
-Consistent security posture in on-demand resource allocation environments
-Unified management and monitoring

Incorporating Data Center Security

Security should be incorporated at the perimeter of the data center for north and south traffic flows and between the servers for west and east traffic flows

Chapter 6: Creating the Design-Campus

Campus Topologies
-Horizontal
-Vertical
-Metro Campus
-Widely distributed
-Hub and Satellite

Legacy 3-Tier Design

-Complex
-Inefficient
-Costly
-Oversubscribed

Consolidating Security

-Eliminates multiple devices
-Improves efficiency
-Lower latency
-Lower power,cooling, and space costs

Collapsing Layers

-Simplifies operations
-Reduces the number of devices
-Reduced number of uplinks
-Reduced latency

Design Guidelines for the Campus

General guidelines to consider when designing campus networks include:
-Ensure design is secure and protects customer resources
-Ensure design allows for network resource availability
-Ensure design is easy to deploy and operate
--Minimal configuration required
--Easily supports deployment of advanced services such as video, UC and virtualization
--Limits the number id platforms to learn, maintain, and spare
--Eliminates blocked links caused by STP and FHRP

Knowing the Trends and Requirements
User driven wireless networking requirements:
-1 AP per 10-15 users or per 400 square feet of coverage area
-Reserve 10% of wired ports for wireless APs

Security Through Isolation

BYOD Through Isolation

Place guest users and devices in an isolated VLAN, such as a guest VLAN, and ideally a unique routing instance

VLAN Connectivity
Create a standard VLAN schema used on all access switches

Subnet Design
Device  Naming Conventions


Access Control Design
-802.1x EAP provides access control
--802.1x can be used to authenticate user ports
--MAC authentication can be used to authenticate other devices (that do not support 802.1x)


single mode authenticates only the first supplicant
single-secure mode allows only one supplicant to connect to the port
multiple mode allows multiples supplicants.Each supplicant is authenticated individually

Using the Top-Down Design Approach
Knowing users, applications, traffic types, and traffic patterns can help determine the best network design


Over Subscription ratios

Over subscription ratios identify the ingress to egress link bandwidth in a south to north direction in the network

Switches are generally categorized has having a non-blocking architecture or a blocking architectures.A non-blocking architecture means that the switch's internal resources can accommodate ingress and egress traffic flows at their maximum rate.

Some Architects use a 20:1 ratio for the access:distribution uplink as a general starting point.

Campus Core:Legacy Campus Architecture

-Oversubscribed interfaces require additional links
-Each wiring closet and each aggregation core device must be managed
-Can be complex to manage and troubleshoot

Common Configuration Scenarios

Layer 2 Access Looped Topology
Layer 2 Access Loop-Free Topology
Layer 3 Access Loop-free Topology

Improving Looped Layer-2 Access Design

Physical Topology No Virtual Chassis
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation and Access

Improving Loop-Free Layer-2 Access Design

Physical Topology No Virtual Chassis
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation and Access

Improving Loop-Free Layer-3 Access Design

Physical Topology No Virtual Chassis -all paths forwarding (OSPF ECMP), fast convergence, L3 license costs?
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation - all links forwarding (LAG)
Logical Topology Virtual Chassis at Aggregation and Access - Fewer unique access switch configurations

Spanning-tree protocols still required if access layer must interface with traditional tiered environment, for example migration or brownfield expansion scenarios

Root Bridge Placement
Spanning Tree Protection features:root protection,bpdu protection,loop protection

Chapter 7:Creating the Design-WAN

Wide Area Network Defined

A wide area network (WAN) is a network covering a broad and geographically disperse area that is used to interconnect business locations and resources.

Enterprise WAN connectivity Functions

Internet Edge, WAN(Branch) Aggregation, Private WAN, Data Center Interconnect

Internet Edge
The internet edge function is typically found in the campus, branch, and data center environments

WAN aggregation
The WAN aggregation function connects remote branch offices to the main campus network

Private WAN
The private WAN function connects all enterprise sites and server as the corporate-managed backbone


Data Center Interconnect
The data center interconnect function connects all corporate data center locations
-disaster recovery/business continuity
-Data Center consolidation and virtualization
-Geo-clustering
-Layer 2 extensions for any reason

Enterprise WAN Design Goals

Should be:
-Easy to deploy
-Flexible and Scalable
-Resilient and Secure
-Easy to Manage
-Service Ready

Connectivity Considerations
What WAN connectivity options are available?
Where will a backup WAN connection be required?
What type of WAN connectivity will be used?Private WAN (multiple classes of service);Public Internet;Provider-Managed MPLS Service (4 classes of service typically available)

WAN Device Roles

WAN devices at the hub location perform on the three roles depending on the WAN requirements:
-WAN aggregation
-Internet Gateway
-VPN Termination

Determining Throughput Requirements

Among other things, the number of users and devices as well the applications and their associated traffic flows determine the throughout requirements.

Performing Considerations

The speed and latency of the WAN are often the main bottleneck between sites in an enterprise network

Note that smaller packets such as voice and video will impact performance the most;therefore when evaluating a router's performance, we recommend using internet mix (IMIX) which is a mix of packet sizes

Consider the following when designing a flexible  branch network:
-Extra capacity can be added on the same platform or by adding additional devices without disrupting the network
-Flexibility to add feature support in the future such as different dynamic path discovery protocols
-Service flexibility to facilitate the introduction of services such as firewall or IPS on same platform
-Different network virtualization techniques;and
-Advanced QoS functionalities

Flexibility can come with higher capital expenditures (CapEx) initially. However, it provides both lower CapEx and operational expenditures (OpEx) in the long term.

VPN Design Considerations

Tunneling packets in IPsec increases packet size
-Additional overhead can exceed 36 bytes
-Must limit the size of packets pre-encryption
-Enforced by limiting the MTU size of IPsec traffic

TCP-MSS size when using IPsec:
-IPsec tunnel mode with no NAT transversal:1463 bytes;and
-IPsec tunnel mode with NAT transversal (UDP):1400 bytes

Using Virtual Routers

Enterprise WAN have the ability to configure multiple routing instances, which are also know as virtual routers (VRs)

Additional scenarios where traffic might have to be kept separate using routing instances include:
-Merging organizations
-Multi-tenant buildings
-Secure facilities
-College campuses


Enterprise WAN:Active/Passive Design

Enterprise WAN:Active/Active Design

A WAN router at the remote branch location has two independent WAN connections to two distinct Layer 3 VPN service Providers. In this case each WAN connection is active.

Enterprise WAN:VPN Design Options

2-Tier Design- Branch to VPN Termination Device
3-Tier Design- Branch to VPN Termination Device and Branch to Data Center
Full Mesh Design- Branch to Branch, Branch to VPN Termination, and Branch to Data Center

Chapter 8:Creating the Design-Data Center

What is a Data Center? A closet, room, floor or entire facility that houses the computing resources and services used by a company

The integrated components in a data center include:
-WAN Domain
-Security Domain
-Layer 2 and Layer 3 Infrastructure Domain
-Compute and Storage Domain
-Management Domain
 

Traditional Data Centers

Most data center access switches are deployed at top-of-rack (TOR), bottom-of-rack (BOR), middle-of-row (MOR), or at end-of-row (EOR)

The switches required in the aggregation and core tiers are typically line-rate, nonblocking switches.

Recognizing the challenges

Using a traditional hierarchical network design in the data center has a number of challenges including:
-Limited scalability
-Inefficient resource usage
-Increased latency

Assessing the Data Center Needs

Some key questions to ask the customer include:
-Does the data center deliver revenue generating services, or does it support your internal IT and campus environments?
-In addition your main data center network, how many other data centers do you have? Will they interconnect?
-What are the grow plans for the server farm for the next two years?Are they 1GBe or 10GBe server ports?
-What are your performance requirements?
-Do you need traffic separation or SLAs?

Categorizing Data Centers
-Data centers vary significantly in size, performance, function and requirements

Enterprise IT-CapEx and OpEx,server virtualization
Public Clouds-Massive scale, Scale out
Performance Oriented-Low latency, Low jitter, High performance

Design Guidelines and Requirements

Common guidelines and requirements include:
-Lower total cost of operations and investment protection
--data center consolidation
--energy and space

-A simple, high performing and highly available environment
--increased bandwidth and lower latency
--high availability,reliability, and modular scalability
--simpler, flatter network
--Storage awareness, network convergence and virtualization

-Aware of users and applications
--Integration of user, application, network, and security policies
--Layer 2 mobility throughout data center

Understand the Trends

DataCenters are moving to a service-centric structure:Storage Pool, Shared Services,Compute Pool

Data Centers are moving to a collapsed structure

Why do Traffic Patterns Matter? Determining the flow and patterns of traffic and the data center helps you identify capacity requirements!

Building the Foundation
-The size and characteristics of the access tier create the foundation of the entire data center network
--The size of the aggregation and core tiers and the number of uplinks is largely determined by the size of the access tier

Using Virtual Chassis in the Design
-Inserting Virtual Chassis in to the design can:
--Simplify the design and management operations
--Improve scale, performance, and high availability
--Reduce cost (cabling, uplinks and equipment)

Virtual Chassis allow up to 10 switches, interconnected through using interchassis connections, 
which may use either special backplane cables, or using 1GbE or 10GbE uplinks. The result is up to 10 line cards that, instead of fitting into a single chassis
Depending on the design, a Spanning tree may not always be required because the member switches functions as a single switch

This logical switch is maintained through a single active configuration file. Juniper recommends that all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration be connected in a ring topology.

Layer 2 at the Access Tier?

Design considerations:
-Architecture and protocol deployment options include Virtual Chassis, xSTP, LAG, and RTG
-Challenges include spanning-tree scaling, fault containment, loop prevention, and blocked spanning-tree links

Simplifying the Topology Further

Use Virtual Chassis technology in the aggregation tier:
-Eliminates or minimizes control plane complexity (such as STP or VRRP)
-Utilizes all uplinks with standards-based, cross-chassis LAG (increases effective uplink bandwidth)

Layer 3 at the Access Tier?
Design considerations:
-Architecture and protocol deployment options include Virtual Chassis, LGA, IGP, and BFD
-Layer 2 domain and Layer 2 mobility are both restricted to a set of access elements

Incorporating Security

Security should be incorporated at the perimeter of the data center for north and south traffic flows and between the servers for west and east traffic flows

Data Center Architectures

Available today include:
-Traditional Layer 2
-Tier-MC-LAG
-Virtual Chassis
-Virtual Chassis Fabric
-QFabric
-Layer3 Clos

Selecting a Design Profile Template

Which profile best matches the data center? Transactional, Mid-Tier,Enterprise IT, HPC and Content Services Hosting
The three key dimensions of a data center profile include:Functionality (routing,security and availability);Cost (capex,opex and TCO); Performance (latency, throughput and oversubscription)

Chapter 9:Business Continuity and Network Enhancements

What is Business Continuity?

Business Continuity is:
-An organization's need to ensure that essential functions can continue during and after a disaster
-The prevention of interruption to mission-critical services
-The ability to reestablish full functionality as quickly as possible following a disaster
-Disaster recovery is not business continuity

Business Continuity Planning

Know your network
-List all functions and services
-Perform a Business Impact Analysis to determine:
--Which functions and services are critical to the company survival
--The cost of both partial and full outages-downtime equals money lost
--How long could an outage be sustained?

Risk Assessment
-What hazards might affect your business?
--IT failure/loss of data
--Flooding
--Power loss
--Fire

-Considered in terms of:
--Impact
--Likelihood


Formulate the Plan
-You cannot plan for everything
-Use the risk assessment to plan for the most likely ones

Test the Plan
-Staff must be notified and know what is expected of them in response and recovery
-After the testing
--Review
--Revise
--Retest

Resiliency
What are the uptime requirements?
-While the customer will typically say "no downtime", in reality there will always be some downtime
-Customers plan for known and unknown downtime and target availability
-99.9% availability tells them downtime cannot exceed 10 minutes per week average

What can affect the uptime of the network?
-Power outage
-WAN failure
-Device power supply failure
-Device failure
-Device firmware upgrades or reboots
-Planned outages (for upgrades or migrations)

Three Nines 99,9% availability means only 10 minutes of total downtime per week (planned and unplanned)

Building a Highly Resilient Network

Link-level redundancy (multiple WAN connections and physical uplinks)
Device-level redundancy (redundant hot-swappable interfaces and power supplies)
Physical device redundancy (redundant devices,VC)

Link-Level Redundancy

When does a second or backup WAN link make sense?
-When your service provider cannot meet your SLA
-when your enterprise relies on VoIP or Unified Communications
-any time the cost of a second link is less then the cost of downtime

Device Level Redundancy

When does a redundant power supply or processing blade make sense?
-Any time redundant power from two sources is provided at the customer premises
--Connect each power supply to a separate power source
-When a two-device HA solution is not used due to costs or complexity
--A second power supply provides some guarantee against device failure

Physical Device Redundancy
When does a physical device redundancy make sense?
-When a HA profile is desired (+3 nines or < 10 minutes per week)
-Any time downtime cannot be afforded due to firmware upgrades or devices reboots
-When zero impact to users and applications is required during failures

Introducing VRRP

Supported on EX Series and MX routers
Is a standards-based RFC 2338

Chassis Clustering

Chassis clustering:
-Connects two identical SRX Series devices into a single logical device
-Uses a control link and a fabric link to connect the two devices

Chassis Clustering: Basic Active/Standby


The goal of a cluster is to be able to move or failover traffic flow from one box to other when needed. To help accomplish this, a special interface type is used:redundant ethernet (reth). A reth interface is a virtual interface.It is active on one of the two nodes only and it has the ability to move or failover to the other node.
When a reth interface fails over to the other node, all its logical interfaces also failover and become active on the other node.

Chassis Cluster Active/Standby with multiple reth interfaces
Chassis Cluster Active/Standby wit LAG

The Small Branch
-SRX device handles routing and security while EX device does switching
-Supports multiple WAN connections and WAN failover

The HA Small Branch
-SRX device HA cluster handles routing and security, while EX device cluster handles switching
-Supports multiple WAN connections and WAN failover

The HA Large Branch
-Two-tier design uses routing between SRX devices and EX switches for HA
-SRX device HA cluster handles routing and security, while EX device cluster handles switching
-Supports multiple WAN connections and WAN failover

Multichassis link aggregation allows you avoid the single point of failure scenario when a switch fails
-LAG is split between two upstream switches appearing as a single switch to downstream device

MC-LAG Positioning Scenarios
-In data centers, MC-LAGs are commonly positioned between servers and the access switches (TORs) as well as between the distribution and core switches

Campus Redundancy Best Practises
Must include:
-Highly available redundant LAN and wireless access for all applications
-Network redundancy, multiple uplinks and network paths distributed across multiple devices
-Hardware redundancy:Redundancy Routing Engines, network fabric, power, and fans
-Redundant wireless access points are clustered and distributed to provide seamless roaming
--Density of access point should provide wire-like reliability and performance

What is a Virtual Chassis?
VC provides 2+N control plane redundancy, where the two Routing Engines have the role of master and backup
The VC has a dual-ring control ring control plane, which can be created either using a 128 Gbps VC fabric connection or over a link aggregation connection using a standard network port

Virtual Chassis Design Considerations
Virtual Chassis can include between two and ten switches:
-Port density factor
-Resilient factor-the more switches. the higher the availability
-System cost-the more switches, the higher the cost

Virtual Chassis Positioning:WAN
-MX Series two member Virtual Chassis in the core
--GRES and NSR must be enabled on both

You can configure a VC on the following MX Series with Trio Modular Port Concentrator (MPC) Modular Interface Controller (MIC) interfaces (for configuration of VC ports) and dual Routing Engines:MX 240/480/960

Virtual Chassis Positioning:Data Center
Virtual Chassis:
-Convenient placement leads to significant savings in cabling cost-TOR, BOR, across racks, and across rows

What is a Virtual Chassis Fabric?

-Two or more interconnected QFX Series, EX Series, or both switch types operating as a single VCF system
--Four or more (up to 20) switches can be member (Leaf or Spine) in a VCF
---QFX5100s can be placed in the Spine or Leaf location
---QFX3500s, QFX3600s, and EX43000s should only be wired as Leaf devices in a mixed scenario

Similarities Between VCF and VC
A VCF is similar to a VC in several ways:
-Member ID=FPC slot
-Console and management sessions (SSH,Telnet) are redirect to the master RE
-Uses VCCP to discover the fabric topology
-Supports pre-provisioned and non-provisioned (dynamic) VCF enablement
-When two or more local interconnects exist between two node, the interconnects are automatically placed into a LAG for load-balancing and redundancy


Differences Between VCF and VC
A VCF is different from a VC in several ways
-Can support up to 20 members switches
--It is the logical upgrade when a Virtual Chassis has reached its capacity
-Uses a Spine and Leaf architecture instead of typical ring topology of a Virtual Chassis
--Based on a Clos three stage (folded) switching fabric
-When multiple paths exist between members, traffic is load balanced across the paths
--In Virtual Chassis, only a single path is ever used (assumes VCP LAG bundle represents a single path)
-Supports Automatic Provisioning

VCF Best Practises

Required for Juniper support
-Spine nodes must be QFX5100 Series switches
-RE role must only be assigned to Spine nodes
-All leafs should be configured for line card role

Other best practises include...
-Every Leaf node should connect by VCP to every Spine node
-Use either all 40Gbps VCPs or all 10Gbps VCPs
-QFX5100-24q should be used as Spine node
-Use either 2 or 4 Spine nodes (better load balancing)
-All Spine nodes should be configured for RE role

Quality of Service and Class of Service
-The goal of QoS technology is to deliver predictable application performance throughout the network
-Best effort delivery is not acceptable for time sensitive traffic such as voice and video
-QoS is experienced end-to-end
--A single hop without QoS can ruin the end-to-end QoS experience
-CoS is the treatment of traffic at an individual node
--Ultimate goal is to ensure consistent end-to-end QoS

Understanding Packet Flow Across a Network
-CoS examines traffic entering the edge of the network
-Traffic is classified into different groups, each receiving different treatment
-Traffic is reclassified as it leaves the network at the edge
-CoS must be configured on each router in the network

Network Traffic Congestion
-Attributed to the hardware itself or to the network deployment
-If a device does not have congestion management features, packets will be dropped or latency will be introduced
-In a TCP/P network, dropped packets will be retransmitted, further increasing the network load
-Traffic congestion management is especially important for time sensitive data and applications such as voice and video

CoS in the Campus Network

Why CoS in the Campus?
-Convergence of voice and data networks
-Differentiation between applications or types of users
-Guaranteed bandwidth, especially on low-speed links

CoS is recommended as a possible solution when users are experiencing the following:
-Timeouts or long delays from applications
-Voice or video quality issues
--Choppy or clipped voice transmissions
--Pixilation or constant buffering of video streams

Junos CoS

-The Junos OS provides a full-featured set of CoS mechanisms:
--32 forwarding classes
--8 queues
--Supports a common set of features from the access layer to the core
-Careful planning is required to ensure the CoS configuration is consistent across all devices
-Equipment across the CoS domain must be interoperable

Physical Layout
Multiple physical divisions:
-Referred to as segments, zones, cells, or pods

Physical Considerations:
-Placement of equipment
-Cabling requirements and restrictions
-Power and cooling requirements

Layout options:
-Top of rack (ToR)
-Bottom of rack (BoR)
-Middle of row (MoR)
-End of row (EoR)

Data Center Cabling
-Cabling is a major cost in the data center
-Any major change to the data center will involve the need to run new cable

Planning for 40-Gigabit Ethernet and 100-Gigabit Ethernet
-Higher bandwidth will be needed in the data center
-The IEEE has defined standard for 40-Gigabit and 100-Gigabit Ethernet

Future-Proofing Data Center Cabling
-Specify minimum of OM3 fiber
--OM4 as an option for extra reach
-Design data centers for 100-150 meter maximum lengths between switches
-Consider higher fiber count requirements
--2 fibers per link becomes 24 fibers
-MTP (or MPO) connectors will become the standard transceiver interface, compared to LC connectors
-Consider cable management and structured cabling

Hot and Cold Aisle Design
-Cool air is drawn in from a common cold aisle
-Hot air is exhausted out a common hot aisle
-Having as much separation and containment of hot and cold air as possible is desirable
-Helps avoid hot spots within the data center

Enabling Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle Design
-Many Rack are designed to assist air flow cold aisle to hot aisle
-Raised floors with perforated tiles, ducts, and plenums can also be used to control air flow

Power Considerations

-Electricity costs rose 88% in the US since 2003

Physical Plant Limitations and Efficiencies

-Equipment selections now include space, power, and cooling efficiency metrics
-Equipment placement within data centers is often directly related to cooling patterns and power grid design
-Achieving these physical goals in conjunction with logical service delivery requirements is critical
-Real estate budgets limit data enter size (in ft2 or m2)
--Goal is to obtain maximum results from a defined footprint
--Use metrics such as ports per rack, servers per rack, workloads per data center
-Power costs are a major factor in a viable design
--Requires maximum efficiency in design and utilization
--Some new data centers are located close to cheaper, greener power
-Up to 50% of power costs are for cooling
--Design equipment and data center layouts for maximum cooling efficiency

Energy Efficiency in Equipment Design
-Sufficient and affordable power is an important determination of design
--Servers and storage require more energy, in total, than network
-Network industry has formed the ECR Initiative to form a common baseline for measuring energy use in equipment
--energy efficiency ratio (EER=Gbps/KW) is the widely used comparison metric
--Allows comparison of similar configurations on energy use

Chapter 10:Network Management and Automation

What is Network Management?
-Network management is a broad topic and means different things to different people
-Reasons for network management:
--Manageability
--Measurement
--Planning (for the future)
--Decreasing downtime
--Configuration
--Accounting


Network Management Methodologies

FCAPS Model
F - Fault management
C - Configuration management
A - Accounting management
P - Performance management
S - Security management

OAMP(T) Model
O - Operations
A - Administration
M - Maintenance
P - Provisioning
(T) - Troubleshooting

Separate Network Management and Production Networks
-Production network loads or failures should no impact the ability to monitor and control the network infrastructure
--Access to device and network performance and fault information is most crucial when the network is in a failure mode
-Separation at the physical interface-level is preferable to logical separation
-Separating production and management networks:
--Mitigates bandwidth contention (performance)
--Simplifies data collection and analysis (that is, management traffic volumes do not skew reported production traffic volumes)

Configuration Management
Consistent approach for physical layout expedites deployment as well as diagnostics:
-Standardize rack layout
-Standardize device slot and module population

Keep like devices running identical software and firmware:
-Expedites troubleshooting
-Simplifies sparing and replacing
-Determination of software versus hardware is much more obvious

Configuration Management

Define a device naming convention and follow it
-Consistency in naming:
--Eases automation of DNS zone edits
--Simplifies pattern matching logic
--Expedites physically locating devices
-Brevity is good, so resist encoding too many things into a hostname (consider using DNS subdomains)

Make use of description fields in device configurations:
-Just like hostnames, define a convention and follow it strictly

Configuration Management

Backup

Provide Secure remote Console Access
-Device failure is imminent
-Failure modes are seldom convenient:
--Many failure modes of network equipment render remote inband access impossible, leaving only the console port
-Ready access to all device serial consoles is critical:
--Even if resources are onsite 24/7 you do not want to rely on being able to find the right combination of cables, adapters, and terminal emulation tools when you need them
-Permanently connect serial consoles to dedicated console server ports
-Ensure that console servers can provide remote IP terminal connectivity to the device serial ports - but only from trusted IP networks
-Configure (and clearly label) one or more serial ports on the console server to provide locally-connected terminal access to the other ports:
--Allows device console access even if the management IP network fails
---Ensure that proper serial cables and adapters are always available for local console server access

Baseline Network Behaviors
-A reference is necessary for good performance or normal behavior in your network
-Continuous monitoring and data collection creates a historical baseline of your network's normal behavior
-Failures and anomalies become easier to detect once these normal behaviors are established

Baseline network behaviors takes place in multiple planes:
-Gross load and error rates
-Traffic type and direction
-Application-level behaviors

Tools are available to baseline:SNMP data collectors;Flow Collection and reporting tools;Topology-aware tools;DPI tools

The more detailed knowledge you have about your network's traffic and flows, the easier managing for optimum performance and reliability becomes

Leverage Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Systems
-Centralizes control of authentication-Enable finer-grain accountability
-AAA servers can enable features not available for device-local authentication
--Password expiration
--Two-factor authentication
-Use of least privileged approach for profiles minimizes exposure
-The value of centralized AAA increases exponentially with the number of devices

Delegate Data Collection and Reduction

-Data collection and thresholding using RMON alarms
--Data collected and analyzed on-device
-NMS notification on threshold crossings

Considerations needed for proper threshold baselining and device resources
-RPM
--Distribute response time monitoring into network devices
--Detect and report data-plane performance degradation that would be transparent to other instrumentation
-Notification reduction using event policy
--Event data reduction on-device by defining event policies

Keep Things as Simple as Possible

Always favor obvious over clever in automation scripts or network configurations

-For Junos devices, this automation can be achieved from within the devices themselves
-Commit scripts:
--Run at commit time
--Inspect the incoming configuration
--Instruct the management daemon to perform actions
-Commit script allow customers better control over how their devices are configured
--Programmatically constrain device configurations according to network architecture constraints
--Defend against common errors by correcting device configurations automatically
-Enabled customized configuration syntax to streamline configuration
-Commit scripts can constrain device configuration
--Codify customer-specific business rules
--Block configurations that break the rules

Examples:
-Insist that each ATM interface does not have more than 1000 PVCs configured
-Insist that an IGP does not use an import policy that will import full routing table
-Insist that all LDP-enabled interfaces are configured for an IGP
-Insist that the re0 and re1 configuration groups are set up correctly and that nothing in the foreground configuration is blocking their proper inheritance

Result:Configuration problems are detected and prevented

(Continue Automate Device Configuration)

-Device configurations can be auto-corrected
-Commit scripts can change configuration:
--Correct errors as they are detected
--Flesh out configuration based on implicit rules

Examples:
-Automatically build a protocols ospf group containing every Ethernet interface configured under [interfaces]
-Automatically configure family iso on any interface with family mpls
-Apply a configuration group for any SONET interface with a description string matching a particular regular expression

Result:Problems are prevented before they occur

Automate repetitive Diagnostic Functions

-Typically, fault diagnosis is performed by following a set of written procedure from a network operations center handbook or something similar
-Most procedure can be automated
-Automating these repetive diagnostic tasks:
--Enforces consistency
---Allow operators and engineers to focus on problem analysis, not data collection

On-device Diagnostic Automation

-On-Device diagnostic scripts are op scripts and event scripts
--Perform any function through RPC supported by Junos NETCONF/XML API and Junos Automation
-Automation scripts allow:
--Automatic diagnosis and repair of network problems
