- The Request for Proposal (RFP) is the process the customer uses to solicit potential vendors for network design proposals
    + Can be short and concise or can contain several pages

- Solicitation from the customer for a network design typically includes:
    + A list of design requirements: including business goals, scope and information on the existing network environment
    + Types of solutions the design must provide: The types of solutions that the design must include, such as wireless, high availability (HA), security, and so forth.
      The wording for these requirements can be generalized or very specific
    + Warranty requirements and legal terms: Warranty requirements for the products you offer, as well as any legal terms attached to the solution

- The customer offen sends the RFP to multiple vendors
    + Use the responses to compare competing proposals
    + Eliminate vendors who cannot meet their requirements

- When responding to the RFP:
    + Be timely, thorough, and honest
    + Use the customer's requested format

- A Request for Information (RFI) can be quite broad in scope and typically only covers the technical aspects of the design request

- RFP takes more effort on the part of both parties because you would also include details on pricing, warranty, timetables, and legal expectations
